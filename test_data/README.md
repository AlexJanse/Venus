The bulk and single-cell test data came from HIV-infected T-cells and monocytes, respectively, accession number PRJNA448285 [link](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaz0802) and PRJNA644611 [link](https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01037-20). 
They were from the same data analyzed in the results sections (Fig. 4, 6), except that the test data were down-sampled so that the file sizes were less than 100 MB, as required by GitHub. 
Reference sequences for both human and viruses were downloaded from NCBIâ€™s RefSeq database.
